> I worked with my classmates to build a tool that makes it easier for customers to find cars and their price ranges online. Customers can subscribe to our service and enter information about the car. The tool then start to look for satisfied cars, as well as price ranges offered by a popular vehicle valuation company.

## Description

According to information provided by the customer--make, model, year, mileage, we found cars on Craiglist and obtained the price ranges from Kbb. Then our tool sends an email to the customer every day to provide the latest information.

## Workflow

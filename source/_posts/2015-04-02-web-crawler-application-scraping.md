## Description

Based on a customer’s need - car model, year of make, mileage, we find the posts on `craiglist`, which agree with the customer’s need and look up the price for the car on sale on the post from `Kbb`. Then our website will show the customer the posts (link to the original posts on craiglist) with cars he is interested in on sale and the price from Kbb. 
Right now, people have to go to craiglist to find the car they are interested in with a seller’s price, and then go to kbb, checking out the review price.
Our website will do the two jobs for the customer automatically, and people can get updated information from our website’s subscription service.

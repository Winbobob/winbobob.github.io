2. Documented the findings and providing remediation suggestions to correct and adverse findings.
3. Drew a threat model using the `Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (MSTMT)`.
4. Developed abuse/misuse diagram for one of the system modules.
5. Detailed misuse case description for one of the attacks in the abuse/misuse case diagram.
6. Made ten security requirements (either functional or non-functional) for OpenMRS.
7. Developed an `attack tree` for one module within OpenMRS.
8. Evaluated one of the system modules against `Jakob Nielson’s Ten Usability Heuristics`.

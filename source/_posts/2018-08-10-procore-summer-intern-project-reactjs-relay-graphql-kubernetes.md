## Description

1. Implemented a GraphQL API for an on-demand staging environment to manage Kubernetes resources on Tectonic.
2. Built the front end of the staging environment using React as the JavaScript library and Relay as the data management solution.
3. Wrote RSpec request specs for the whole GraphQL API.
4. Set up CircleCI to continuously run RSpec tests, build docker images and push docker images to Quay.io.

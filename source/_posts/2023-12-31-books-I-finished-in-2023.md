- "If I feel that I can help make something better, then I cannot stop myself from jumping in. I have deep sense of duty and find it very hard to say no." I always have the same feelings.
- The And-But phenomenon. When writing evaluation for a man, people tend to write "XXX, and [details about this man's terrific future]". When writing reviews for a woman, people tend to write "XXX, but [details about some issue or personality problem]".

# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change
- The way we see things is the source of the way we think and the way we act. The way we see things is often a product of the things we seek or our deeper motivations.
- A "paradigm shift" experience: 
  - Two battleships assigned to the training squadron had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather for several days. I was serving on the lead battleship and was on watch on the bridge as night fell. The visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the captain remained on the bridge keeping an eye on all activities. Shortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, "Light, bearing on the starboard bow." "Is it steady or moving astern?" the captain called out. Lookout replied, "Steady, captain," which meant we were on a dangerous collision course with that ship. The captain then called to the signalman, "Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you change course 20 degrees." Back came a signal, "Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees." The captain said, "Send, I’m a captain, change course 20 degrees." "I'm a seaman second class," came the reply. "You had better change course 20 degrees.” By that time, the captain was furious. He spat out, "Send, I’m a battleship. Change course 20 degrees." Back came the flashing light, "I’m a lighthouse." We changed course.
- The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. - Albert Einstein
- Happiness is the desire and ability to sacrifice what we want now for what we want eventually.
- Interdependent is the choice only independent people can make.
- Eternal student syndrome: someone who tries to avoid getting a job by taking more educational courses. It can also refer to a lack of prioritization.
- Nothing can hurt me, no one can hurt me without my consent.
- Anytime we think the problem is out that with others or in circumstances, that very thought itself is the problem. Because we empower what's out there to continue to control us.
- Measure twice, cut once. Jayme Cox gave me this feedback after my ZooKeeper migrations caused serval high severity incidents.
- Management is doing things right, leadership is doing the right things.
- E.M. Gray, the author of "The Common Denominator of Success", found that the one denominator all successful people share wasn't hard work, good luck, or astute human relations, though those were all important. The one factor that seemed to transcend all the rest embodies the essence of Habit #3 - Putting First Things First. The successful person has the habit of doing the things failors don't like to do. They don't like doing them either, necessarily, but their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose.
- Time management matrix quadrant 2 - Not urgent, but important things. Like working out and reading, I've been working out for 8 years and reading for 2 years, I will keep doing them.
- Pareto principle (80/20 rule): 80 percent of results flow out of 20 percent of activities.

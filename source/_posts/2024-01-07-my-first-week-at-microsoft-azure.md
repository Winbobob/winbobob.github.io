## Looking Back on the Last Five Years, Looking Forward to the Next Five Years

I joined Pinterest in 2019. It has been four-and-helf years since then. I met tons of incredible people at Pinterest and learnt a lot. Really enjoy the time I spent at Pinterest.

When I first joined Pinterest, I never knew that I would leave the company and join Microsoft Azure after four and half years.

Quoting <a href="http://zhewe.me/blog/my-first-week-at-pinterest">my previous post</a>: people may foresee the beginning but never know the ending. We need to withstand loneliness, accept failure, do the right (maybe not easy) things.

**Again, I am looking forward to the next five years!**

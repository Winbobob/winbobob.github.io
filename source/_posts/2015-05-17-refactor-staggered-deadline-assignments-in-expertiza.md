## What is staggered-dealine assignment?

> Consider `Wiki 1a` and `Wiki 1b` assignment in `NCSU CSC517` class.  They were structured as separate assignments, with separate signup sheets, teams, and reviews. But actually, since only one of the two was done by any student, it wouldâ€™ve been better to have a single assignment. Still, some topics could be done soon after the course started, whereas others were better done after we had studied related topics in class.

> This raises the idea of a `staggered-deadlne assignment`, where different topics have different submission and review deadlines, rather than all topics having the same deadline.

## Description

1. Refactor `signup_sheet_controller.rb` to implement staggered-deadline addignment and dependency graphs between topics.
2. Test the `varying rubric by rounds` feature to make sure it works OK.
3. Write `Rspec` unit test and increase the test coverage by `1.01%`.

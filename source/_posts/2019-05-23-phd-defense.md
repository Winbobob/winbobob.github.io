> On May 23rd 2019, I successfully defensed my Ph.D. dissertation: "Helping Students Make Better Contributions to Open-Source Software Projects". 

I owe my sincere thanks to Dr. Edward Gehringer, my advisor, for his all-time support and
guidance. I am very grateful to him for his valuable time, continuous advice and patient feedback. I learned a lot from our weekly meetings and his insights that helped me to generate creative ideas in my mind.

I would like to thank my other committee members, Dr. Christopher Parnin, Dr. Sarah Heckman,
sand Dr. Ranga Vatsavai, for being my committee and providing valuable feedback about the work.

I thank Yang Song, my good teacher, and helpful friend, for recommending me to join Dr.
Gehringerâ€™s research team, guiding and cooperating with me to finish many papers, and going
fishing with me.

Finally, I thank all other friends for their encouragement and supports at every moment.

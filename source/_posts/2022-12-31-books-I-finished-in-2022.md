# The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers
- This book talks about how to become an excellent CEO including tips like how to recruit executives that fits the company under the current scale.
- However, there are still some tips that are helpful to me as an individual contributor:
  1. When you are a part of a family, you cannot always think about yourself first. Stop being a boy, become a man.
  2. The company takes care of the people, the products, and the profits—in that order.
  3. Training is a good investment for your new hires. You will not waste the training time. By contrast, good training can increase employee productivity significantly.
  4. People judge you for what you did instead of how you feel. Both hero and coward will feel afraid, but the hero can fight the feelings off and make things done.

# Bringing Up Bébé: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting
Several learnings and thoughts:
  1. The book mentioned that the French children, even 2-3 months old, could have 4 meals at the same time as adults (breakfast: 8 am, lunch: noon, goûter: 4 pm, and dinner: 8 pm) and could sleep the whole night. I find it difficult for my almost 2-month-old daughter to follow these eating and sleeping mechanisms. But I am trying to let her sleep longer (4-6 hours) during the night.
  2. It's important to let kids wait and delay to satisfy their requirements.
  3. Even for babies who cannot speak, they can understand most things.
  4. It's crucial to have adult time and separate from your children, which is beneficial for both you and your kids.
  5. In order for parents to have authority, you should say yes to most of the things and only say no for several things that you do not want your kids to do.
  6. Autonomy is one of the child's most basic needs.

# The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change
- This book talks about tips and suggestions about how to be a good mentor, tech lead, manager, senior manager, director, and executive.
- I finished the chapters involving the mentor, tech lead, and manager.
- Hopefully, I could have a chance to read the rest chapters.
- What I was inspired from five out of ten chapters:
  - As an individual contributor:
    1. It is crucial to talk about your recent life a little bit in the one-on-one meetings with your manager, so your manager will have context about the reasons behind your energy level changes.
    2. Good one-on-one meetings does not only include status updates (which may be better to written in emails or chats). Try to bring in some topics to meetings.
    3. Your manager expects you to bring solutions not problems. When you have a problem, instead of demanding that your manager solves it for you, try to ask for advice about how s/he might approach the problem.
    4. You may be an introvert and/or not find socializing easy, but the conscious effort and practice in getting to know new people and helping them succeed will pay off.
  - As a manager:
    1. Listening is the first and the basic skill of managing people.
    2. Delivering feedback to your team members quickly (immediately after a meeting if possible) is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something.
    3. You can switch tracks (management track and technical track) if you want.
    4. Your technical skills is an important criteria to become a successful engineering manager. Try to implement small features and bug fixes, which could help you to stay close enough to the code base, and identify and experience the bottleneck and process problems.
    5. Doubling rule of software estimation: whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.

# Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know
- As we think and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians.
  - Preacher mode: when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy, we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals.
  - Prosecutor mode: when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning, we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. I often act as a prosecutor during the arguments.
  - Politician mode: when we’re seeking to win over an audience, we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents.
- If knowledge is power, knowing what we don't know is wisdom.
- The sweet spot of confidence (neither overconfident nor underconfident)
 - You can be confident in your ability to achieve the goal in the future while maintaining the humility to question whether you have the right tools in the present.
- Action items from the book that inspire me
  - Seek out information that goes against your views
  - Embrace the joy being wrong
  - Learn something new from each person you meet
  - Build a challenge network (my wife in my case), not just a support network
  - Don't shy away from constructive conflicts
  - Practice the art of persuasive listening
  - Less is often more
    - If you have too many arguments, you will dilute the power of each and everyone. They are going to be less well-explained.
  - Invite kids to do multiple drafts and seek feedback from others
  - Stop asking kids what they want to be when they grow up
    - Kids don't have to define themselves in terms of career.
    - A single identity can close the door of alternatives.
    - Instead of narrow their opportunities, help them broad their possibilities.
- I also learned lots of psychology, sociology and other terms.
  - [Anton syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_syndrome)
  - [Armchair quarterback syndrome](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/armchair_quarterback)
    - The opposite of impostor syndrome.
  - [First-instinct fallacy](https://www.psychology-lexicon.com/cms/glossary/39-glossary-f/9594-first-instinct-fallacy.html)
    - It happened a lot when I answered the multiple-choice questions on exams. Many times I stuck to my instinct and got the wrong answer.
  - Totalitarian ego
    - The mental gate-keeper that keeps threatening information out of our heads.
  - [Group polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization) 
  - [Overview effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect)
  - [Inverse charisma](https://myquestionlife.com/inverse-charisma/#:~:text=far%20more%20powerful.-,Inverse%20charisma,-is%20someone%E2%80%99s%20ability)
    - Magnetic quality of a great listener
  - Binary bias
    - A basic human tendency to seek clarity and closure by simplifying a complex continuum into two categories.
  - Psychological safety
    - Forstering a climate with respect, trust, and openness in which people can raise concerns and suggestions without fear of reprisal.
    - Not a matter of relaxing standards, making people feel comfortable, being nice and aggreeable, or giving unconditional praise.
  - [Escalation of commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment)
    - Grit (passion and perseverance) might prevent us from rethinking.
    - There's a fine line between heroic persistence and foolish  stubbornness. Sometimes the best kind of grit is gritting our teeth and turning around.
  - [Counterfacutal thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfactual_thinking)
    - I am conducting conterfacutal thinking a lot, what if ...
    - As I learned from the Computational Applied Logic course, if the IF statement is true, you can append anything statements after it. I always do this trick with my wife.
- [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus)
- [Planck's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle)

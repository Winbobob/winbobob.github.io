* Homework    405 pts.
    * Programs    325 points
        * Ruby program    35 pts.
            * Solve LeetCode problem in Ruby
        * Ruby on Rails program    70 pts.
            * Start early
            * Try to achieve all the requirements including extra credits (trust me, they are not difficult)
            * Most of the time, UI does not need to be pretty unless it is explicitly mentioned in the requirement.
            * Deploy your application to one cloud platform. Heroku is a good choice.
        * OSS project    80 pts.
            * Please read the general requirement at the very top of project requirement docs. It may only take 5 minutes, but you can earn 3-5 more points or even more after you read it.
            * Make sure your code pass the Travis CI. If you make some changes to the system, please change the corresponding tests as well.
            * Resolve the CodeClimate issues as many as you can. Some issues, such as abc complexity, can be ignored. You could ask teaching staff to approve these issues.

    * Writing assignments    80 pts.
        * Writeup on OSS project    40 pts.
            * Please do not include an Expertiza introduction section. It is redundant and professor does not like it.
            * Please do not paste many code to the wiki since we already have GitHub.
            * Please fit your screenshot to the page.
            * If your project relates to a UI change, it is a good practice to manually change the html to show the final UI to the reader, although when you write the wiki, you do not write any code yet.
            * User stories are a good ways to show the whole functionality.
            * Please refer to wikis in previous years.

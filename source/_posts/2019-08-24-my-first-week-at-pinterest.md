> I just finished my first week at Pinterest. Summarize my feeling in two words: awesome and fantastic! Fun facts: I met CEO Ben Silbermann four times in person (twice in a cafeteria, once in a corridor and once in happy hour).

## Looking Back on the Last Five Years, Looking Forward to the Next Five Years

I came to America in 2014. It has been five years since then.

When I first studied at NC State University as a masters student, I never knew that I would get a Ph.D. degree and join Pinterest.

People may foresee the beginning but never know the ending. We need to withstand loneliness, accept failure, do the right (maybe not easy) things.

**I am looking forward to the next five years!**

> Hello everyone, my name is Zhewei Hu. I am a site reliability engineer at Pinterest. Before that, I was a Ph.D. student under the direction of Dr. Ed Gehringer. I was the teaching assistant for the Object-Oriented Design and Development (OODD) course, aka. CSC/ECE 517 for more than 4 years. I want to share some of my experience to help you conquer this course and get A+. I will discuss my experience based on syllabus and make the content as short as possible. There are 1000 regular credits with many extra credits. If you could get 970 credits or more, you will receive an A+. This is the first part.


## Part 1 - Homework (405 pts)
  * Programs (325 pts)
    * Ruby program (35 pts)
      * You are required to solve LeetCode-like problems in Ruby.
      * Teaching staff will use automated tests to test your code. If your programs pass all tests, you will get full credits.

    * Ruby on Rails program (70 pts)
      * Please start early
      * Try to achieve all the requirements including extra-credit ones (trust me, they are not difficult)
      * Most of the time, UI does not need to be pretty unless it is explicitly mentioned in the requirement.
      * Deploy your application to one cloud platform. Heroku is a good choice.

    * OSS project (80 pts) and Final project (140 pts)
      * Please start early
      * If you have any questions, ask your mentor.
      * Please read the general requirements at the very top of project docs. It may only take 5 minutes, but you can earn 3-5 more points or even more after you read it.
      * <b>Please make sure your code pass the Travis CI.</b> If you make some changes to the system, please change the corresponding tests as well.
      * <b>Please resolve the CodeClimate issues as many as you can.</b> Some issues, such as abc complexity, can be ignored. You could ask teaching staff to approve these issues.
    
  * Writing assignments (80 pts)
    * Please do not include an Expertiza introduction section. It is redundant and the professor does not like it.
    * Please do not paste many code to the wiki since we already have GitHub pull requests.
    * Please fit your screenshots to the page.
    * If your project relates to a UI change, it is a good practice to manually change the html code and make a screenshot to show the final version of UI to the reader (although when you write the wiki, you do not write any code yet).
    * User stories are a good ways to show the whole functionality.
    * Please refer to wikis in previous years.

## Part 2 to 5 (595 pts)

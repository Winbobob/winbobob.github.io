      <b>Graduate Research and Senior Teaching Assistant</b><br/>
      I have more than 3 years' <b>Ruby on Rails</b> development experience. Since 2014 I began to work on an open source project named <a href="https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza" target="_blank">Expertiza</a>. Expertiza is a web application through which students can submit and peer-review learning objects (articles, code, etc.). This system is used by more than 21 institutions all over the world. Now I am the <a href="https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">chief maintainer and contributor</a> of the system and contributed almost 1000 commits to the master branch. I am familiar with the <b>RSpec</b> testing framework and write tests to increase the test coverage from 28% to 48%.

      <b>Site Reliability Engineer Intern</b><br/>
      In 2018 summer, I interned as a site reliability engineer at Procore Technologies. During this period, I implemented a <b>GraphQL</b> API for an on-demand staging environment to manage <b>Kubernetes</b> resources on <b>Tectonic</b>. And I also built the front end of this system using <b>React</b> and <b>Relay</b>. Besides, I wrote RSpec specs for the whole GraphQL API and set up <b>CircleCI</b> to continuously run tests, build docker images and push images to <b>Quay.io</b>.

      <b>Software Developer Intern</b><br>
      In 2016 summer, I interned as a software engineer at Offers.com in Austin, TX. During this period, I utilized <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>Sequel</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b> to build a Key Performance Index (KPI) report for the marketing team. And I also fixed more than 15 issues from JIRA scrum board with Agile methodology.  What is more, I implemented <b>Rubocop</b> on 6 projects to enforce coding guidelines (corrected more than 7000 LOC) and created a pre-commit git hook to ensure the code quality of each commit.

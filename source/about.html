<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">

  <p>My name is <strong itemprop="name">Zhewei Hu</strong>. I am <strong>{{ myage }} years old</strong>. I am a second-year master student majoring in <em>Computer Science</em> at <em>NC State University</em>. I was born and grew up in <em>Cixi</em>, the city below <em>Shanghai</em>.</p>

  <p>I started to "play" with Ruby and Rails in Nov. 2014, so it is more than one year now. Since that time, I began to work on an <em>open source project</em> named <a href="https://expertiza.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">Expertiza</a>.</p>

  <p>Expertiza is a web application supported by <em>NSF</em> written by Ruby where students can submit and peer-review learning objects. I contributed more than 350 commits to Expertiza master branch on <a href="https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. And I designed and deployed several key features, such as <em>multi-part rubrics</em>, <em>team lazy initialization</em>, <em>automatic review mapping strategy</em>, <em>student suggested topics</em>, etc.</p>

  <p>I am also familiar with RSpec testing framework. Recently, I refactored and merged several pull requests to increase the test coverage from <b>28%</b> to <b>36%</b>.</p>

  <p>This semester, I am a research assistant of Expertiza group. My job focuses on maintain the system and do research related to education data mining. I have already jointly published <b>2</b> papers. They are <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7344292&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D7344292" target="_blank">"Pluggable Reputation Systems for Peer Review a web-service approach"</a> in <em>45th IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference, 2015</em> and <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-25515-6_3" target="_blank">"Closing the Circle - Use of Studentsâ€™ Responses for Peer-Assessment Rubric Improvement"</a> in <em>14th International Conference on Web-based Learning, 2015.</em></p>

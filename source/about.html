<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">

  <p>My name is <strong itemprop="name">Zhewei Hu</strong>. I am <strong>{{ myage }} years old</strong>. I was born and grew up in <em>Cixi, Zhejiang Province, China</em>.</p> 

  <p>In 2016 Spring semester, I received the degree of <b>Master of Science in Computer Science</b> from North Carolina State University. My master thesis is <a href="http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/handle/1840.16/10975" target="_blank">"Scaffolding the Grading Process for Peer Review Assignments: A Pluggable Reputation Web-Service Approach"</a>. I am working as a <b>Software Engineer Intern</b> at <a href="http://www.offers.com/" target="_blank"> Offers.com</a> at Austin, Texas during this summer. And I am a <b>Ph.D. student</b> in the Computer Science department of North Carolina State University now.</p>

  <p>I started to "play" with Ruby and Rails in Nov. 2014, so it is almost two years now. Since that time, I began to work on an <b>open source project</b> named <a href="https://expertiza.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">Expertiza</a>.</p>

  <p>Expertiza is a web application supported by NSF written in Ruby on Rails framework through which students can submit and peer-review learning objects (articles, code, websites, etc).  Now I am the <b>core maintainer and contributor</b> of Expertiza and contributed more than 500 commits to Expertiza master branch on <a href="https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. And I designed and deployed several key features, such as multi-part rubrics, team lazy initialization</em>, automatic review mapping strategy, student suggested topics, staggered-deadline assignment, etc.</p>

  <p>I am also familiar with <b>RSpec</b> testing framework. Recently, I refactored and merged several pull requests to increase the test coverage from <b>28%</b> to <b>44%</b>. And I also used <b>Rubocop</b> auto-correction functionality to enforce ruby coding guidelines. It improved the Code Climate GPA from <b>0.9</b> to <b>2.4</b>, and the code style of Expertiza is becoming better and better.</p>

  <p>During 2016 summer holiday, I worked as a <b>software engineer intern</b> at <a href="http://www.offers.com/" target="_blank"> Offers.com</a> at Austin, Texas. During this period, I utilized <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>Sequel</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b> to build a Key Performance Index (KPI) report for the marketing team. And I also fixed more than 15 issues from <b>JIRA scrum board</b> with <b>Agile methodology</b>.  What is more, I implemented Rubocop on 6 projects to enforce coding guidelines (corrected more than 7000 LOC) and created a <b>pre-commit git hook</b> to ensure the quality of commits.</p>

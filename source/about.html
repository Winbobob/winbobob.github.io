<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">

  <p>My name is <strong itemprop="name">Zhewei Hu</strong>. I am <strong>{{ myage }} years old</strong>. I was born and grew up in <em>Cixi, Zhejiang Province, China</em>.</p>

  <p>In 2016 Spring semester, I received the degree of <b>Master of Science in Computer Science</b> from North Carolina State University. My master thesis is "<a href="http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/handle/1840.16/10975" target="_blank">Scaffolding the Grading Process for Peer Review Assignments: A Pluggable Reputation Web-Service Approach</a>". During 2016 summer I interned as a Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.offers.com/" target="_blank">Offers.com</a> in Austin, TX. During 2017 summer I interned as Aspera Software Engineer at <a href="http://asperasoft.com" target="_blank">IBM</a> in Emeryville, CA. Currently, I am a second-year Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Science at North Carolina State University.</p>

  <p>I started to "play" with Ruby and Rails in Nov. 2014, so it is {{ railsusage }} now. Since that time, I began to work on an <b>open source project</b> named <a href="https://expertiza.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">Expertiza</a>. Expertiza is a web application supported by NSF written in Ruby on Rails framework through which students can submit and peer-review learning objects (articles, code, websites, etc).  Now I am the <b>chief maintainer and contributor</b> of Expertiza and contributed more than 800 commits to Expertiza master branch on <a href="https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. And I designed and deployed several key features, such as multi-part rubrics, team lazy initialization, automatic review mapping strategy, student-suggested topics, staggered-deadline assignment, course project bidding, etc. I am familiar with the <b>RSpec</b> testing framework. I continuously create and merge pull requests to increase the test coverage from <b>28%</b> to <b>47%</b>. And I also used <b>Rubocop</b> auto-correction functionality to enforce ruby coding guidelines.</p>

  <p>In 2016 summer, I interned as a software engineer at Offers.com in Austin, TX. During this period, I utilized <b>Ruby on Rails</b>, <b>Sequel</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b> to build a Key Performance Index (KPI) report for the marketing team. And I also fixed more than 15 issues from JIRA scrum board with Agile methodology.  What is more, I implemented Rubocop on 6 projects to enforce coding guidelines (corrected more than 7000 LOC) and created a pre-commit git hook to ensure the code quality of each commit.</p>

  <p>In 2017 summer I interned as a DevOps engineer at IBM. During this period, I closely worked with other team members and finished 2 projects. For the first project, I created an infrastructure test suite written by <b>InSpec</b> to verify configuration results converged by <b>Test Kitchen</b> and <b>Chef</b>. For my second project, I migrated a big data sharing platform to <b>Kubernetes</b> cluster.</p>

  <p>In 2018 summer, This summer I interned as a site reliability engineer at Procore Technologies. During this period, I implemented a <b>GraphQL</b> API for an on-demand staging environment to manage <b>Kubernetes</b> resources on <b>Tectonic</b>. And I also built the front end of this system using <b>React</b> and <b>Relay</b>. Besides, I wrote RSpec specs for the whole GraphQL API and set up <b>CircleCI</b> to continuously run tests, build docker images and push images to <b>Quay.io</b>.</p>

  <p>In 2019 summer, I will join Pinterest as a site reliability engineer.</p>
